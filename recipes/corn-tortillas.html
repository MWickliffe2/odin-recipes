    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A very simple recipe for homemade corn tortillas, courtesy of Patrick at the "Mexican Please" website.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Masa Harina</li>
        <li>1.5 cups warm water</li>
        <li>.5 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add 2 cups Masa Harina and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of the warm water and stir until the water is
        absorbed. Add the rest of the water incrementally until the flour melds into a dough. Use your hands to knead the dough
        into a cohesive ball.</li>
        <li>If the dough is sticking to your hands simply add a few sprinklings of Masa Harina to dry it out. Conversely, if the
        dough is still crumbly then you can add splashes of water until it becomes cohesive.</li>
        <li>Separate the dough into golf ball sized chunks, this will make tortillas approximately 4 inches across.</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough balls using a flat bottomed pan or a tortilla press. Be sure to line each side of the dough ball with
        plastic or Ziploc pieces. I usually just cut off the top of a gallon sized Ziploc bag and then make slits down the
        sides, leaving it connected at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or comal to medium-high heat. (Lately I use a tad over medium heat on my stove and this will have brown
        spots forming in about 60 seconds.)</li>
        <li>Add a tortilla to the skillet and flip it after 10 seconds. Then cook each side for about a minute or until light brown
        spots are forming on the underside.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking the rest of the tortillas. I usually put one in the skillet and flatten the next one to expedite the
        process. Once cooked you can keep them warm by wrapping them in a tea towel or using a dedicated tortilla warmer. Serve
        immediately.</li>
    </ol>
